What's this?
-------
This is a sort of homelab journal. How-to guides will probably be the primary content. Don't expect to find equipment reviews here--if I had that sort of budget, the lab would be far larger.

Topics may include:
- Routing & Switching
- ESXi
- VoIP (Asterisk 15+)
- Systems Management
- Fails!

How long have you been doing this?
--------
This incarnation of the lab was plugged in for the first time on January 22nd, 2018. That's what the PDU says anyway.

I've been experimenting with Linux servers since roughly 2010. The first rack server I received arrived in the spring of 2011.

What got you into this?
-----
Probably the 1U server that showed up on my doorstep in 2011.
